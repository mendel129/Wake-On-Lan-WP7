# Wake-On-Lan-WP7




As mentioned on Mendel's blog: http://mendel129.wordpress.com/projects/wol/

A project of mine, a wake-on-lan client for WP7

It was the first real wake-on-lan application made for wp7.
Real, meaning it doesnâ€™t use any intermediate proxy server or whatever. This app operates directly from your device, using the sockets in WP7.1 .

V1.1:

updated with live tiles
Using them you can wake your computer with one click of a button 8-)

V1.2

per-device different icons :-)

v1.3

page animations, own device icons, some other visual improvements :)
